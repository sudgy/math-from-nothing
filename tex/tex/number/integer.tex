\chapter{The Integers} \label{chap_integer}

\begin{definition}
    Define a relation $\sim$ on $\N \times \N$ where $(a_1, a_2) \sim (b_1,
    b_2)$ is defined to mean $a_1 + b_2 = b_1 + a_2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    The relation $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $\N \times \N$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    \textit{Reflexivitity.}  We must check $a_1 + a_2 = a_1 + a_2$, which is a
    reflexive equality.

    \textit{Symmetry.}  We must prove that if $a_1 + b_2 = b_1 + a_2$, then $b_1
    + a_2 = a_1 + b_2$.  This is true by the symmetry of equality.

    \textit{Transitivity.}  We must prove that if $a_1 + b_2 = b_1 + a_2$ and
    $b_1 + c_2 = c_1 + b_2$, then $a_1 + c_2 = c_1 + a_2$.  We can add the first
    two equalities to get
    \[
        a_1 + b_2 + b_1 + c_2 = c_1 + b_2 + b_1 + a_2.
    \]
    We can cancel $b_2$ and $b_1$ to get the result.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Define the type of integers $\Z$ to be the type $(\N \times \N)/\usim$.
\end{definition}

\section{Addition}

\begin{definition}
    Define an operation $\oplus : \N \times \N \to \N \times \N \to \N \times
    \N$ given by
    \[
        (a_1, a_2) \oplus (b_1, b_2) = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2).
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    The operation $\oplus$ is well-defined under the equivalence relation
    $\sim$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that for all $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, if $a \sim b$ and $c \sim
    d$, we have $a \oplus c \sim b \oplus d$.  Thus, we have
    \[
        a_1 + b_2 = b_1 + a_2
    \]
    and
    \[
        c_1 + d_2 = d_1 + c_2
    \]
    and must prove that
    \[
        a_1 + c_1 + b_2 + d_2 = b_1 + d_1 + a_2 + c_2.
    \]
    This follows directly by rearranging and applying the previous two
    equalities.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    Definition addition in the integers as the binary operation given by Theorem
    \ref{binary_op_ex} and the previous lemma.
\end{instance}

\begin{instance}
    Addition of integers is commutative.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that
    \[
        (a_1, a_2) \oplus (b_1, b_2) \sim (b_1, b_2) \oplus (a_1, a_2).
    \]
    This reduces to
    \[
        a_1 + b_1 + b_2 + a_2 = b_1 + a_1 + a_2 + b_2,
    \]
    which follows by the commutativity of natural number addition.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    Addition of integers is associative.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that
    \[
        (a_1, a_2) \oplus ((b_1, b_2) \oplus (c_1, c_2)) \sim
        ((a_1, a_2) \oplus (b_1, b_2)) \oplus (c_1, c_2).
    \]
    This reduces to
    \[
        (a_1 + (b_1 + c_1)) + ((a_2 + b_2) + c_2) =
        ((a_1 + b_1) + c_1) + (a_2 + (b_2 + c_2)),
    \]
    which follows by the associativity of natural number addition.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    Define zero in the integers to be $[(0, 0)]$.
\end{instance}

\begin{instance}
    Zero is an additive identity in the integers.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that
    \[
        (0, 0) \oplus (a_1, a_2) \sim (a_1, a_2).
    \]
    This reduces to
    \[
        0 + a_1 + a_2 = a_1 + 0 + a_2,
    \]
    which follows by 0 being an identity in the natural numbers.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Given $(a_1, a_2) : \N$, define
    \[
        \ominus (a_1, a_2) = (a_2, a_1).
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    $\ominus$ is well-defined under $\sim$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that if $(a_1, a_2) \sim (b_1, b_2)$, then $\ominus (a_1, a_2)
    \sim \ominus (b_1, b_2)$.  Simplified, we have $a_1 + b_2 = b_1 + a_2$ and
    must prove that $a_2 + b_1 = b_2 + a_1$, which follows from commutativity.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    Definition additive inverses in the integers as the unary operation given by
    Theorem \ref{unary_op_ex} and the previous lemma.
\end{instance}

\begin{instance}
    Negation is a left inverse in the integers.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that
    \[
        \ominus (a_1, a_2) \oplus (a_1, a_2) \sim (0, 0).
    \]
    This reduces to
    \[
        a_2 + a_1 + 0 = 0 + a_1 + a_2,
    \]
    which follows by the properties of natural number addition.
\end{proof}

\section{Multiplication}

\begin{definition}
    Define an operation $\otimes : \N \times \N \to \N \times \N \to \N \times
    \N$ given by
    \[
        (a_1, a_2) \otimes (b_1, b_2) = (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2, a_1b_2 + a_2b_1).
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    The operation $\otimes$ is well-defined under the equivalence relation
    $\sim$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that for all $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, if $a \sim b$ and $c \sim
    d$, we have $a \otimes c \sim b \otimes d$.  Thus, we have
    \begin{equation} \label{int_mult_wd_ab}
        a_1 + b_2 = b_1 + a_2
    \end{equation}
    and
    \begin{equation} \label{int_mult_wd_cd}
        c_1 + d_2 = d_1 + c_2
    \end{equation}
    and must prove that
    \[
        a_1c_1 + a_2c_2 + b_1d_2 + b_2d_1 =
        b_1d_1 + b_2d_2 + a_1c_2 + a_2c_1.
    \]
    We can multiply equation \ref{int_mult_wd_ab} by $c_1$ and $c_2$ to get
    \begin{equation} \label{int_mult_wd_ab1}
        a_1c_1 + b_1c_1 = b_1c_1 + a_2c_1
    \end{equation}
    and
    \begin{equation} \label{int_mult_wd_ab2}
        a_1c_2 + b_1c_2 = b_1c_2 + a_2c_2,
    \end{equation}
    and we can multiply equation \ref{int_mult_wd_cd} by $b_1$ and $b_2$ to get
    \begin{equation} \label{int_mult_wd_cd1}
        b_1c_1 + b_1d_2 = b_1d_1 + b_1c_2
    \end{equation}
    and
    \begin{equation} \label{int_mult_wd_cd2}
        b_2c_1 + b_2d_2 = b_2d_1 + b_2c_2.
    \end{equation}
    We can add equations \ref{int_mult_wd_ab1} and \ref{int_mult_wd_cd1} to get
    \begin{align}
        a_1c_1 + b_2c_1 + b_1c_1 + b_1d_2 &=
        b_1c_1 + a_2c_1 + b_1d_1 + b_1c_2 \nonumber \\
        a_1c_1 + b_2c_1 + b_1d_2 &= a_2c_1 + b_1d_1 + b_1c_2,
        \label{int_mult_wd_eq5}
    \end{align}
    and we can add equations \ref{int_mult_wd_ab2} and \ref{int_mult_wd_cd2} to
    get
    \begin{align}
        b_1c_2 + a_2c_2 + b_2d_1 + b_2c_2 &=
        a_1c_2 + b_2c_2 + b_2c_1 + b_2d_2 \nonumber \\
        b_1c_2 + a_2c_2 + b_2d_1 &= a_1c_2 + b_2c_1 + b_2d_2.
        \label{int_mult_wd_eq6}
    \end{align}
    We can now add equations \ref{int_mult_wd_eq5} and \ref{int_mult_wd_eq6} to
    get
    \begin{align*}
        a_1c_1 + b_2c_1 + b_1d_2 + b_1c_2 + a_2c_2 + b_2d_1 &=
        a_2c_1 + b_1d_1 + b_1c_2 + a_1c_2 + b_2c_1 + b_2d_2 \\
        a_1c_1 + b_1d_2 + a_2c_2 + b_2d_1 &=
        a_2c_1 + b_1d_1 + a_1c_2 + b_2d_2 \\
        a_1c_1 + a_2c_2 + b_1d_2 + b_2d_1 &=
        b_1d_1 + b_2d_2 + a_1c_2 + a_2c_1.
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    Definition multiplication in the integers as the binary operation given by
    Theorem \ref{binary_op_ex} and the previous lemma.
\end{instance}

\begin{instance}
    Multiplication of integers is commutative.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that
    \[
        (a_1, a_2) \otimes (b_1, b_2) \sim (b_1, b_2) \otimes (a_1, a_2).
    \]
    This reduces to
    \[
        a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + b_1a_2 + b_2a_1 =
        b_1a_1 + b_2a_2 + a_1b_2 + a_2b_1
    \]
    which follows by the commutativity of natural number multiplication and
    addition.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    Multiplication of integers is associative.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that
    \[
        (a_1, a_2) \otimes ((b_1, b_2) \otimes (c_1, c_2)) \sim
        ((a_1, a_2) \otimes (b_1, b_2)) \otimes (c_1, c_2).
    \]
    This reduces to
    \begin{align*}
        &{}a_1(b_1c_1 + b_2c_2) + a_2(b_1c_2 + b_2c_1) +
        (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)c_2 + (a_1b_2 + a_2b_1)c_1 \\
        {}={}&
        (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)c_1 + (a_1b_2 + a_2b_1)c_2 +
        a_1(b_1c_2 + b_2c_1) + a_2(b_1c_1 + b_2c_2),
    \end{align*}
    which expands to
    \begin{align*}
        &{}a_1b_1c_1 + a_1b_2c_2 + a_2b_1c_2 + a_2b_2c_1 +
        a_1b_1c_2 + a_2b_2c_2 + a_1b_2c_1 + a_2b_1c_1 \\
        {}={}&
        a_1b_1c_1 + a_2b_2c_1 + a_1b_2c_2 + a_2b_1c_2 +
        a_1b_1c_2 + a_1b_2c_1 + a_2b_1c_1 + a_2b_2c_2,
    \end{align*}
    which has the same terms on both sides.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    Multiplication of integers distributes over addition.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that
    \[
        (a_1, a_2) \otimes ((b_1, b_2) \oplus (c_1, c_2)) \sim
        (a_1, a_2) \otimes (b_1, b_2) \oplus (a_1, a_2) \otimes (c_1, c_2).
    \]
    This reduces to
    \begin{align*}
        &{}a_1(b_1 + c_1) + a_2(b_2 + c_2) + a_1b_2 + a_2b_1 + a_1c_2 + a_2c_1\\
        {}={}&
        a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_1c_1 + a_2c_2 + a_1(b_2 + c_2) + a_2(b_1 + c_1),
    \end{align*}
    which expands to
    \begin{align*}
        &{}a_1b_1 + a_1c_1 + a_2b_2 + a_2c_2 + a_1b_2 + a_2b_1 + a_1c_2 + a_2c_1
        \\ {}={}&
        a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_1c_1 + a_2c_2 + a_1b_2 + a_1c_2 + a_2b_1 + a_2c_1,
    \end{align*}
    which has the same terms on both sides.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    Define one in the integers to be $[(1, 0)]$.
\end{instance}

\begin{instance}
    One is a multiplicative identity in the integers.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that
    \[
        (1, 0) \otimes (a_1, a_2) \sim (a_1, a_2).
    \]
    This reduces to
    \[
        1a1 + 0a2 + a2 = a1 + 1a2 + 0a1,
    \]
    which simplifies to
    \[
        a_1 + a_2 = a_1 + a_2.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    For all $a$ and $b$ in $\Z$, if $0 = ab$, then either $0 = a$ or $0 = b$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    After a bit of simplification, the hypothesis $0 = ab$ becomes
    \[
        a_1b_2 + a_2b_1 = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2,
    \]
    and the conclusion becomes that either $a_1 = a_2$ or that $b_1 = b_2$.  If
    $a_1 = a_2$, we're done, so assume that $a_1 \neq a_2$.  Without loss of
    generality, assume that $a_1 < a_2$.  Then by Theorem \ref{nat_lt_ex}, there
    exists a $c : \N$ such that $a_1 + S(c) = a_2$.  Then
    \begin{align*}
        a_1b_2 + (a_1 + S(c))b_1 &= a_1b_1 + (a_1 + S(c))b_2 \\
        a_1b_2 + a_1b_1 + S(c)b_1 &= a_1b_1 + a_1b_2 + S(c)b_2 \\
        S(c)b_1 &= S(c)b_2,
    \end{align*}
    and we can cancel $S(c)$ because $S(c) \neq 0$, giving $b_1 = b_2$ as
    required.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    Multiplication of integers is cancellative.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be integers such that $0 \neq c$ and $ca = cb$.
    Rearranging we get $0 = c(a - b)$, so by the previous lemma, either $c = 0$
    and $a - b = 0$.  The first case is impossible becaues $0 \neq c$, and from
    the second case we get $a = b$.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    The integers are not trivial.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We will prove that $0 \neq 1$.  If $0 = 1$, then we would have $(0, 0) \sim
    (1, 0)$, which means that $0 = 1$ in the natural numbers, which is
    impossible because the natural numbers are not trivial.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all natural numbers $n$, $\iota(n) = [(n, 0)]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The proof will be by induction on $n$.  When $n = 0$,
    \[
        \iota(0) = 0 = [(0, 0)],
    \]
    so the base case is true.  Now assume that $\iota(n) = [(n, 0)]$.  Then
    \[
        \iota(S(n)) = 1 + \iota(n) = 1 + [(n, 0)].
    \]
    To check if this is equal to $[(S(n), 0)]$, we must check if
    \[
        (1, 0) \oplus [(n, 0)] \sim [(S(n), 0)],
    \]
    which simplifies to
    \[
        1 + n + 0 = S(n) + 0 + 0,
    \]
    which is true.
\end{proof}

\section{Order}

\begin{definition}
    Given $(a_1, a_2)$ and $(b_1, b_2)$ in $\N \times \N$, define $a \leqq b$ to
    mean $a_1 + b_2 \leq a_2 + b_1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    The relation $\leqq$ is well-defined under the relation $\sim$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By propositional extensionality and symmetry, it suffices to prove that for
    all pairs $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, if $a \sim b$, $c \sim d$, and $a \leqq
    c$, then $b \leqq d$.  Simplified, we have
    \begin{align*}
        b_1 + a_2 &= a_1 + b_2, \\
        c_1 + d_2 &= d_1 + c_2, \\
    \intertext{and}
        a_1 + c_2 \leq a_2 + c_1.
    \end{align*}
    Adding the two equations to the inequality gives
    \[
       a_1 + c_2 + b_1 + a_2 + c_1 + d_2 \leq a_2 + c_1 + a_1 + b_2 + d_1 + c_2,
    \]
    and cancelling gives
    \[
        b_1 + d_2 \leq b_2 + d_1
    \]
    meaning that $(b_1, b_2) \leqq (d_1, d_2)$ as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    Define order in the integers as the operation obtained by applying Theorem
    \ref{binary_op_ex} to the previous lemma.
\end{instance}

\begin{instance}
    The order in $\Z$ is connex.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that for all $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$, either $a_1 + b_2 \leq a_2
    + b_1$ or $b_1 + a_2 \leq b_2 + a_1$.  This is true because the order on
    $\N$ is connex.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    The order in $\Z$ is antisymmetric.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that if
    \[
        a_1 + b_2 \leq a_2 + b_1
    \]
    and
    \[
        b_1 + a_2 \leq b_2 + a_1,
    \]
    then
    \[
        a_1 + b_2 = b_1 + a_2.
    \]
    This follows from the antisymmetry of the order in $\N$ after using
    commutativity.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    The order in $\Z$ is transitive.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that if
    \[
        a_1 + b_2 \leq a_2 + b_1
    \]
    and
    \[
        b_1 + c_2 \leq b_2 + c_1,
    \]
    then
    \[
        a_1 + c_2 \leq a_2 + c_1.
    \]
    We can add $c_2$ to the first inequality to get
    \[
        a_1 + b_2 + c_2 \leq a_2 + b_1 + c_2
    \]
    and we can add $a_2$ to the second inequality to get
    \[
        a_2 + b_1 + c_2 \leq a_2 + b_2 + c_1.
    \]
    By transitivity of the order in $\N$,
    \[
        a_1 + b_2 + c_2 \leq a_2 + b_2 + c_1,
    \]
    and by cancelling $b_2$ we get the desired result.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    The order in $\Z$ is left additive.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that if $a_1 + b_2 \leq a_2 + b_1$, then
    \[
        c_1 + a_1 + c_2 + b_2 \leq c_2 + a_2 + c_1 + b_1,
    \]
    which follows directly from the additivity of the order in $\N$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} \label{int_pos_nat_ex}
    For all integers $a$, if $0 \leq a$, then there exists a natural number $n$
    such that $a = n$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Because $0 \leq a$, we have $a_2 \leq a_1$.  Then by Theorem
    \ref{nat_le_ex}, there exists some $c$ such that $a_2 + c = a_1$.  This
    equation is equivalent to the equation
    \[
        [(c, 0)] = [(a_1, a_2)],
    \]
    so $c$ is the required natural number.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} \label{int_neg_nat_ex}
    For all integers $a$, if $a \leq 0$, then there exists a natural number $n$
    such that $a = -n$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Because $a \leq 0$, we have $0 \leq -a$, so by the previous theorem there
    exists a natural number $n$ such that $-a = n$, so $a = -n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    The order in $\Z$ is multiplicative.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    Let $0 \leq a$ and $0 \leq b$.  Then by Theorem \ref{int_pos_nat_ex}, there
    exist natural numbers $m$ and $n$ such that $a = m$ and $b = n$.  Then the
    result simplifies to
    \[
        0 + m0 + 0n \leq 0 + mn + (0)(0).
    \]
    The left-hand side simplifies to zero, and because all natural numbers are
    positive, the result is true.
\end{proof}

Thus, we have now seen that the integers are an ordered integral domain, so they
are also a domain, a commutative ring, etc.

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$, $[(a_1, a_2)] < [(b_1, b_2)]$ if and
    only if $a_1 + b_2 < a_2 + b_1$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Unfold the definitions of $<$ and $\leq$, after using commutativity the two
    expressions are identical.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} \label{int_lt_suc_le} \label{int_le_suc_lt}
        \label{int_le_pre_lt} \label{int_lt_pre_le}
    For all $a$ and $b$, $a < b + 1$ if and only if $a \leq b$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Simplified, we must prove that $a_1 + b_2 < a_2 + b_1 + 1$ if and only if
    $a_1 + b_2 \leq a_2 + b_1$.  This follows directly from Theorem
    \ref{nat_lt_suc_le}
\end{proof}

Note that the previous theorem also gives other similar results involving
relating inequalities and strict inequalities with a $+ 1$ or $-1$ somewhere.

\begin{theorem} \label{int_pos_nat1_ex}
    For all $a : \Z$, if $0 < a$, then there exists an $n : \N$ such than $a =
    S(n)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    By Theorem \ref{int_pos_nat_ex}, there exists an $n : \N$ such that $a = n$.
    If $n = 0$, because $0 < a$, we would have $0 < 0$, which is a
    contradiction.  Thus, $n \neq 0$, so it is the successor of another natural
    number $m$, meaning that $a = S(m)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} \label{int_neg_nat1_ex}
    For all $a : \Z$, if $0 < a$, then there exists an $n : \N$ such than $a =
    -S(n)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The proof is similar in form to Theorem \ref{int_neg_nat_ex}.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    The integers are Archimedean.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that if $0 < x$ and $0 < y$, then there exists an $n : \N$
    such that $x < ny$.  Because $0 < y$, $1 \leq y$, and we can multiply by $x$
    to get $x \leq xy$.  Because $0 < y$, we can add it to the right-hand side
    to get $x < y + xy = (x + 1)y$.  By Theorem \ref{int_pos_nat1_ex}, there
    exists some natural number $n$ such that $x = n + 1$, so $x < (n + 2)y$,
    showing that $n + 2$ suffices.
\end{proof}

\section{The Relation Between Integers And Other Types}

In this whole section, let $\U$ be a type with whatever algebraic operations are
needed.  We will be exploring several ways to connect $\U$ with $\Z$.

\subsection{Multiplying by Integers}

\begin{definition}
    Given an $(n_1, n_2) : \N \times \N$ and an $a : \U$, define the product
    \[
        (n_1, n_2)a = n_1a - n_2a.
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    The product in the preceding definition is well-defined under the
    equivalence relation $\sim$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that if $a_1 + b_2 = b_1 + a_2$, then
    \[
        a_1c - a_2c = b_1c - b_2c.
    \]
    We can multiply $a_1 + b_2 = b_1 + a_2$ by $c$ to get
    \[
        a_1c + b_2c = b_1c + a_2c,
    \]
    and rearranging we get the desired result.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Given a value $a : \U$, define the product of an integer $n$ with $a$ to be
    the operation given by Theorem \ref{unary_op_ex} and the previous lemma.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a : \U$, $0_\Z a = 0_\U$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \[
        0_\Z a = 0_\N a - 0_\N a = 0_\U - 0_\U = 0_\U.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a : \Z$, $a0_\U = 0_\U$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \[
        a0_\U = a_10_\U - a_20_\U = 0_\U - 0_\U = 0_\U.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For al $a : \U$, $1_\Z a = a$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \[
        1_\Z a = 1_\N a - 0_\N a = a.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a : \Z$ and $b$ and $c$ in $\U$, if $b + c = c + b$, then
    \[
        a(b + c) = ab + ac.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that for all natural numbers $a_1$ and $a_2$,
    \[
        a_1(b + c) - a_2(b + c) = a_1b - a_2b + a_1c - a_2c.
    \]
    Because $b$ and $c$ commute, we can expand and rearrange by the theorems for
    the product of natural numbers with $\U$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a$ and $b$ in $\Z$ and $c : \U$,
    \[
        (a + b)c = ac + bc.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that for all natural numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$,
    \[
        (a_1 + b_1)c - (a_2 + b_2)c = a_1c - a_2 c + b_1c - b_2c.
    \]
    Again, this follows directly by the theorems for the product of natural
    numbers with $\U$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a$ and $b$ in $\Z$ and $c : \U$
    \[
        a(bc) = (ab)c.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that for all natural numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$,
    \[
        a_1(b_1c - b_2c) - a_2(b_1c - b_2c) =
        (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)c - (a_1b_2 + a_2b_1)c.
    \]
    Once again, this follows directly by the theorems for the product of natural
    numbers with $\U$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all integers $a$ and $b$ and $c$ in $\U$,
    \[
        a(bc) = (ab)c.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that for all natural numbers $a_1$ and $a_2$,
    \[
        a_1(bc) - a_2(bc) =
        (a_1b - a_2b)c.
    \]
    After distributing, this follows directly by the theorems for the product of
    natural numbers with $\U$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a : \Z$ and $b : \U$,
    \[
        -(ab) = (-a)b.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that for all natural numbers $a_1$ and $a_2$,
    \[
        -(a_1b - a_2b) = a_2b - a_1b.
    \]
    This follows directly from the properties of addition.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a : \Z$ and $b : \U$,
    \[
        -(ab) = a(-b).
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that for all natural numbers $a_1$ and $a_2$,
    \[
        -(a_1b - a_2b) = a_1(-b) - a_2(-b).
    \]
    After simplifying, this follows directly by the theorems for the product of
    natural numbers with $\U$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a : \Z$ and $b$ and $c$ in $\U$, if $b + c = c + b$,
    \[
        ab + c = c + ab.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that for all natural numbers $a_1$ and $a_2$,
    \[
        a_1b - a_2b + c = c + a_1b - a_2b.
    \]
    Because $b$ and $c$ commute, by the properties of multiplying natural
    numbers with values in $\U$, all these terms commute.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a$ and $b$ in $\Z$ and all $c : \U$,
    \[
        ac + bc = bc + ac.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \[
        ac + bc = (a + b)c = (b + a)c = bc + ac.
    \]
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Integers in Other Types}

\begin{lemma}
    The function from $\N \times \N$ to $\U$ given by $(a_1, a_2) \to
    \iN(a_1) - \iN(a_2)$ is well-defined under the equivalence relation $\sim$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that if $a_1 + b_2 = b_1 + a_2$, then
    \[
        \iN(a_1) - \iN(a_2) = \iN(b_1) - \iN(b_2).
    \]
    We can rearrange this to
    \[
        \iN(a_1) + \iN(b_2) = \iN(b_1) + \iN(a_2),
    \]
    and the result follows from $\iN$ being additive.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    We can define an inclusion $\iZ : \Z \rightarrow \U$ as the application of
    Theorem \ref{unary_op_ex} to the previous lemma.  After this chapter, the
    function $\iZ$ will be not be written and will be assumed to be used any
    time an integer appears in an expression involving other types, unless the
    notation is necessary to avoid ambiguity.
\end{definition}

\begin{instance}
    If $\iN$ is injective in $\U$, then $\iZ$ is as well.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that if
    \[
        \iN(a_1) - \iN(a_2) = \iN(b_1) - \iN(b_2),
    \]
    then
    \[
        a_1 + b_2 = b_1 + a_2.
    \]
    We can rearrange the first equation to get
    \[
        \iN(a_1) + \iN(b_2) = \iN(a_2) + \iN(b_1),
    \]
    and because $\iN$ is additive we get
    \[
        \iN(a_1 + b_2) = \iN(a_2 + b_1).
    \]
    Because $\iN$ is injective we get the desired result.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a : \Z$, $a1_\U = \iZ(a)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that
    \[
        a_1 1_\U - a_2 1_\U = \iN(a_1) - \iN(a_2),
    \]
    which follows directly from the corresponding theorem for the natural
    numbers.
\end{proof}

\begin{instance} \label{from_int_one}
    $\iZ$ is unital.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    \[
        \iZ(1) = \iN(1) - \iN(0) = 1 - 0 = 1.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{instance} \label{from_int_plus}
    $\iZ$ is additive.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{align*}
        \iZ(a + b) &= \iN(a_1 + b_1) - \iN(a_2 + b_2) \\ &=
        \iN(a_1) + \iN(b_1) - \iN(a_2) - \iN(b_2) \\ &=
        \iN(a_1) - \iN(a_2) + \iN(b_1) - \iN(b_2) \\ &=
        \iZ(a) + \iZ(b).
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{instance} \label{from_int_mult}
    $\iZ$ is multiplicative.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{align*}
        \iZ(ab)
        &= \iN(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2) - \iN(a_1b_2 + a_2b_1) \\
        &= \iN(a_1)\iN(b_1) + \iN(a_2)\iN(b_2)
            - \iN(a_1)\iN(b_2) - \iN(a_2)\iN(b_1) \\
        &= \iN(a_1)(\iN(b_1) + \iN(b_2)) - \iN(a_2)(\iN(b_1) + \iN(b_2)) \\
        &= (\iN(a_1) - \iN(a_2)) (\iN(b_1) - \iN(b_2)) \\
        &= \iZ(a) \iZ(b).
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $a : \Z$ and $b : \U$, $ab = \iZ(a)b$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \[
        ab = a_1b - a_2b = \iN(a_1)b - \iN(a_2)b = (\iN(a_1) - \iN(a_2))b
        = \iZ(a)b.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{instance}
    $\iZ$ is orderly.
\end{instance}
\begin{proof}
    We must prove that if $a_1 + b_2 \leq a_2 + b_1$, then $\iN(a_1) - \iN(a_2)
    \leq \iN(b_1) - \iN(b_2)$.
    \begin{align*}
        a_1 + b_2 &\leq a_2 + b_1 \\
        \iN(a_1 + b_2) &\leq \iN(a_2 + b_1) \\
        \iN(a_1) + \iN(b_2) &\leq \iN(a_2) + \iN(b_1) \\
        \iN(a_1) - \iN(a_2) &\leq \iN(b_1) - \iN(b_2).
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all $n : \N$, $\iZ(\iN(n)) = \iN(n)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \[
        \iZ(\iN(n)) = \iZ([(n, 0)]) = \iN(n) - \iN(0) = \iN(n).
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} \label{from_int_unique}
    For all functions $f : \Z \to \U$, if $f$ is additive and unital, then $f =
    \iZ$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $x$ be any integer.  We must prove that $f(x) = \iZ(x)$.  If $x \leq 0$
    and we could prove that $f(-x) = \iZ(-x)$ we could then prove that $-f(x) =
    -\iZ(x)$, so $f(x) = \iZ(x)$.  Thus, we may assume without loss of
    generality that $0 \leq x$.  Because $0 \leq x$, by Theorem
    \ref{int_pos_nat_ex} there exists some natural number $n$ such that $x =
    \iN(n)$.  The proof will be by induction on $n$.  When $n = 0$,
    \[
        f(\iN(0)) = f(0) = 0 = \iN(0),
    \]
    so the base case is true.  Now assume that $f(\iN(n)) = \iN(n)$.  Then
    \[
        f(\iN(S(n))) = f(1 + \iN(n)) = f(1) + f(\iN(n)) = 1 + \iN(n) =
        \iN(S(n)),
    \]
    so the theorem is true by induction.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For all integers $a$, $\iZ(a) = a$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \[
        \iZ(a) = \iN(a_1) - \iN(a_2) = [(a_1, 0)] - [(a_2, 0)] = [(a_1, a_2)] =
        a.
    \]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    The integers are initial in \vtt{Ring} and \vtt{CRing}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    $\iZ$ is a morphism from $\Z$ to any ring, and by Theorem
    \ref{from_int_unique}, they are the only morphism.
\end{proof}

\end{document}
